# RumorsSimulation
>   CSE 622 Project

## Overview of Program:
* There are N students at the party (N is an even integer 2 ≤ N ≤ 10,000)
* At some point, all students pair off at random and talk for exactly one minute.
* At the end of the minute, all students again pair off with another person at random.
* In the beginning one student starts spreading the rumor. He/She spreads the rumor to his conversation partner at noon.
* Every person who has knowledge of the rumor obeys these rules:
  1. The likelihood of spreading a rumor to another person is 0.5
  2. After a person has heard the rumor 2 times, he/she will assume everyone has heard the rumor and will no longer try to spread it further.
